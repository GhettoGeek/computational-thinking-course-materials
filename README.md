# Computational Thinking Course Materials - Introduction to Intelligent Systems

Course materials for a modeling-based computational thinking course ([Introduction to Intelligent Systems](https://catalog.memphis.edu/content.php?filter%5B27%5D=IIS&filter%5B29%5D=1010&filter%5Bcourse_type%5D=-1&filter%5Bkeyword%5D=&filter%5B32%5D=1&filter%5Bcpage%5D=1&cur_cat_oid=8&expand=&navoid=200&search_database=Filter#acalog_template_course_filter)).

The goal of the course if for students to understand artificial and natural phenomena in fields like biology, psychology, neuroscience, economics, and engineering through computational concepts and practices.

The course has two phases:

- Understand how simple rules generate complex behavior
- Understand how to use data to infer these simple rules

The course is intended for students with little or no programming experience from any major. It is not a programming course but introduces some basic programming concepts. It uses a blocks-based programming language called [PencilCode](https://pencilcode.net/) to create models and drive simulations.

## Structure

The repository is divided between:

- Instructional planning materials
- Student exercises/labs
- Resources

Exercises require students to be logged in to PencilCode.
Then accessing the link for an exercise will open the `Guide` in PencilCode and load a custom blocks palette specific to the exercise.
